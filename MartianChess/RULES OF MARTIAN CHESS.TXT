RULES OF THE GAME

Martian Chess is an abstract strategy game for four players

Player 1 is the Top Left Corner, Player 2 top right, Player 3 bottom right, Player 4 bottom Left

Each player starts with nine pieces: three small (pawns), three medium (drones), and three large (queens).
Each player controls only the pieces on their board and if a piece moves to another board that player 
gains the piece

If you have captured a Queen you may use one of your Drones and place it on one of your pawns to switch them out for
the Queen this is called promotion. The same can be done for two pawns to switch to a rook, but only if you have already taken one from
an opponent

Pawns move one space diagonally in any direction. (Unlike chess pawns, they may move backwards.)
Drones horizontally or vertically, without jumping. (Like chess rooks)
Queens move any distance horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, without jumping. (The same as chess queens.)

The game ends when one player runs out of pieces or if the game has gone seven turns without a piece being taken or promoted. Players then 
compute their scores by adding up the point values of the pieces they captured: queen = 3, drone = 2, pawn = 1. 
The player with the highest total wins the game.
